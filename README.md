# Renewables in YYYY

The Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade (Ministerstvo pr≈Ømyslu a obchodu, MPO) each year publishes a statistical report [Renewable Energy Resources in YYYY](https://www.mpo.cz/cz/energetika/statistika/obnovitelne-zdroje-energie/obnovitelne-zdroje-energie-v-roce-2020--263512/) in the form of a PDF file which contains statistics about renewable energy production in the country.

This package provides two commands for scraping links to these PDF reports and parsing tables in ther reports (for selected year).

One script scrapes links to these PDF reports from the [website](https://www.mpo.cz/cz/energetika/statistika/obnovitelne-zdroje-energie/) and saves them to CSV.

Another script parses selected pdf report using [Camelot](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/):
* reads data tables,
* removes spaces between numbers and
* saves tables as CSV files in the directory for the relevant year. It also saves one Excel file for the year (one worksheet per table).
